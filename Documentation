First build was completed using Freestyle Jenkins Pipeline option


For second build, objective was add a feature that would fail with a new test when built with jenkins
-Adding testing for mul2 on the test py file
-Added a mul2 function to calc.py
-Pushing to git to update on Jenkins to build
-Build has indeed failed


To fix this build. I needed to modify the add2cal file and modify the inherent functions of sys.arg of taking in two arguments
in a single command and make it so that the user will select the operation as well as adding individual arguements as input.
--changed lists from sys.arg to mod_number
--changed the add2 variable to a if statement to call either add2 or mul2(which was added in the calc2)

There are some unnecessary items in teh code that were edited out instead of being deleted in-case references were needed to undo this.
