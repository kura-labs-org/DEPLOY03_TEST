# DEPLOY03_TEST

<h1 align=center>Deployment 3</h1>

Welcome to deployment 3. We have been covering the fundamentals of python, now itâ€™s time to apply your python knowledge to a python application called Add2Vals. This python application is a simple command line application that adds two arguments and outputs the value to the user. You have been tasked to first test the Add2Val application with the already made test_calc.py and produce an XML report. 

Once you have ran a test build and produced a test report. Create an additional feature or component to the Add2Vals application. Create a test that will fail when you test Add2 a second time and then get your test to pass. 

***Documentation and screenshot requirements:*** 
- [x]Fork (https://github.com/kura-labs-org/DEPLOY03_TEST)
- [x]Screenshot the first successful test build.
- [x]Document your added component or feature.
- [x]Screenshot your failed test and document why your test failed.
- [x]Screenshot your successful test build and document what you did to fix your failed test build  
- [x]Initiate a pull request to the kura_labs_org/DEPLOY_3_TEST repo with your documentation, screenshots(add screenshots to documentation), test_calc.py with your added test, and add2vals.py with your added feature or component.
